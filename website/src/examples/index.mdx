## Usage

[![Edit react-responsive-modal](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/9jxp669j2o)

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import 'react-responsive-modal/styles.css';
import { Modal } from 'react-responsive-modal';

const App = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  const onOpenModal = () => setOpen(true);
  const onCloseModal = () => setOpen(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={onOpenModal}>Open modal</button>
      <Modal open={open} onClose={onCloseModal} center>
        <h2>Simple centered modal</h2>
      </Modal>
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

- If you are using Next.js, you need to import the styles in `pages/_app.js` or `pages/_app.tsx`.
- If you are using Create React App, you need to import the styles in `index.js` or `index.tsx`.

### Multiple modals

You can render multiple modals at the same time. Clicking on the overlay or pressing "esc" will only close the last modal.

### Focus Trapped modal

By default, when the modal open, the first focusable element will be focused. Press Tab to navigate between the focusable elements in the modal. You can notice that when the modal is open, you can't focus the elements outside of it.
If you want to disable this behavior, set the `focusTrapped` prop to `false`.
